I'm Alex Billig, a postdoctoral research associate at the [UCL Ear Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/). I use modelling, psychophysics, electrophysiology, and magnetic resonance imaging to study how we make sense of auditory mixtures, understand speech, and appreciate music.


Background
======

After a BA in Mathematics at Oxford, I worked in the financial sector with an interlude as a freelance musician. I gained an MSc in Music, Mind & Brain at Goldsmiths College in 2011 then worked as a research assistant with cochlear implant patients at the MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences unit. My PhD, supervised by Bob Carlyon at the same institute, concerned the effects of attention and experience on auditory scene analysis. I joined Ingrid Johnsrude at the University of Western Ontario as a postdoc in 2016, investigating the neural basis of ambiguous speech perception. I am now on a grant with Tim Griffiths (Newcastle University) investigating auditory working memory, but working closely with Maria Chait's lab at the UCL Ear Institute and the Department of Neurosurgery at University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics.
