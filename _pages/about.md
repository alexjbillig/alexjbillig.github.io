I'm Alex Billig, a postdoctoral research associate at the [UCL Ear Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/). I use modelling, psychophysics, electrophysiology, and magnetic resonance imaging to study how we make sense of auditory mixtures, understand speech, and appreciate music.


Background
======

After a BA in Mathematics at Oxford, I worked in the financial sector with an interlude as a freelance musician. In 2011 I gained an MSc in Music, Mind & Brain at Goldsmiths College then worked as a research assistant with cochlear implant patients at the MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences unit. My PhD, supervised by Bob Carlyon at the same institute, concerned the effects of attention and experience on auditory scene analysis. I then joined Ingrid Johnsrude at the University of Western Ontario as a postdoc, investigating the neural basis of understanding ambiguous speech.
