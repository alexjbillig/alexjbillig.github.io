I'm Alex Billig, a postdoctoral research associate at the [UCL Ear Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/). I use modelling, psychophysics, electrophysiology, and magnetic resonance imaging to study how we make sense of auditory mixtures, understand speech, and appreciate music.


Background
======

After a BA in Mathematics at Oxford, I worked in the financial sector with an interlude as a freelance musician. I gained an MSc in Music, Mind & Brain at Goldsmiths College in 2011 then worked as a research assistant with cochlear implant patients at the MRC Cognition & Brain Sciences unit. My PhD, supervised by Bob Carlyon at the same institute, concerned the effects of attention and experience on auditory scene analysis. I joined [Ingrid Johnsrude's lab](https://www.conchlab.ca/home) at the University of Western Ontario as a postdoc in 2016, investigating the neural basis of ambiguous speech perception. I am now on a grant with [Tim Griffiths (Newcastle University)](https://www.auditorycognition.org/) investigating auditory working memory, but working closely with [Maria Chait's lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ear/research/chaitlab/people) at the UCL Ear Institute and the [Department of Neurosurgery](https://hbrl-neurosurgery.lab.uiowa.edu/) at the University of Iowa.
